# Dotfiles repository
This is to hold my set of configuration, or ".<blah>" files (dotfiles). There are different branches for my different setups I've had. `makesymlinks.sh` will install my configuration files via symlinking to files in this repo. It will make a backup of your files, but I've never tried to restore it.
